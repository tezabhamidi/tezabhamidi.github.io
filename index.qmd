## About me

My name is Teza. I am a Scientist researching primarily on Signal Processing, Machine Learning and their implementations in real-time Hardware. Mostly this will be a research journal, in which I want to be documenting my academic experiments and reflections. 

There's still only minimal stuff on here as yet. But things are being cooked up as you read this, powered by Quarto. Please do check back soon for updates!
